//! # Making `ptrace` async
//!
//! Getting asynchronous notifications for a tree of child processes is tricky.
//! The common way is to just call `waitpid(-1)` in the tracer process and let
//! that scoop up every event for every child of the current process. This is
//! what `strace` and `rr` do to receive `ptrace` stop events. The problem is
//! that we shouldn't do something like that in a library like Reverie since we
//! don't know what other (untraced) processes the user has spawned. Calling
//! `waitpid(-1)` will consume and "steal" exit events from processes we aren't
//! actively tracing.
//!
//! The best solution would be one where we can wait on all child processes of a
//! specific subtree.
//!
//! ## Failed ideas
//!
//!  1. As an initial dumb implementation, we simply called `waitid` on all child
//!     processes one by one in a round-robin fashion until an event was finally
//!     received. While it worked, this wasn't the best solution for two reasons:
//!     (1) it uses a lot of CPU which starves the guest of CPU resources and
//!     slows everything down to a crawl, and (2) it didn't allow us to receive
//!     `PTRACE_EVENT_EXIT` events out-of-band which is necessary for canceling
//!     pending futures in the event a guest process is suddenly killed.
//!  2. Using `pidfd_open(2)` to receive events over file descriptors would be
//!     great, but `ptrace` events are not receivable with `pidfd`. This might
//!     change in the future, but there is currently no motivation among Linux
//!     devs to implement support for that. (Folks hate the complexity of ptrace
//!     and are fearful of introducing new security vulnerabilities.)
//!  3. Using `tokio::task::spawn_blocking` to simply call `waitid()` on the
//!     process we're interested in works, but is about twice as slow as (1)
//!     because of the overhead of locking a mutex and shuffling bits of data
//!     in/out of the Tokio thread pool.
//!  4. Process groups sound like the ideal solution, but it is possible for a
//!     process to escape a process group by simply calling `setpgid(2)`. Thus,
//!     such a solution would need to be aware of all calls to `setpgid` and
//!     `setsid` to perform proper bookkeeping and maintain an internal set of
//!     process groups.
//!  5. We could fork off a child process that calls `waitpid(-1)`, which then
//!     sends events back to the tracer process via a pipe. The forked process
//!     would need to call `prctl` with `PR_SET_CHILD_SUBREAPER` so that orphaned
//!     processes don't escape the process tree. This is similar to [what Bazel
//!     does](https://jmmv.dev/2019/11/bazel-process-wrapper.html) to keep track
//!     of the process tree of a build rule. Unfortunately, this won't work
//!     because `ptrace` must be only be called by the *thread* that spawned the
//!     initial process.
//!
//! ## Current implementation
//!
//! Currently, we spawn one thread per guest thread who each call `waitid` in a
//! loop on an individual thread/process ID. The nice thing about this is that we
//! can receive `PTRACE_EVENT_EXIT` events "out-of-band" and use that to cancel
//! any futures that may be pending in a tool's `handle_syscall_event`. This
//! approach also avoids the overhead of `tokio::task::spawn_blocking` by not
//! locking a `Mutex` each time an event is received. (An `AtomicI32` plus an
//! `AtomicWaker` can be used instead.) The downside of this approach is that we
//! can end up spawning a lot of guest threads.

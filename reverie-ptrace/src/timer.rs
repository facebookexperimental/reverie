//! Timers monitor a specified thread using the PMU and deliver a signal
//! after a specified number of events occur. The signal is then identified
//! and transformed into a reverie timer event. This is intended to allow
//! tools to break busywaits or other spins in a reliable manner. Timers
//! are ideally deterministic so that `detcore` can use them.
//!
//! Due to PMU skid, precise timer events normally must be driven to completion
//! via single stepping. This means the PMI is scheduled early, and events with
//! very short timeouts require immediate single stepping. Immediate stepping is
//! acheived by artificially generating a signal that will then be delivered
//! immediately upon resumption of the guest. If delivery is already past the
//! target, the overshoot is recorded and the event is delivered at the observed
//! counter because single stepping cannot move the guest backward. If another
//! Tool-observable stop arrives first with the delivery point already reached,
//! that stop cancels the event and the overshoot is recorded there. A stop
//! that `Timer::disregard_stop()` hands back to the event does not cancel it
//! and records nothing; whatever decides the event later finds the delivery
//! point reached too, and the disregarded stop's own finding is recorded
//! only if the thread exits before anything decides the event. A disregarded
//! stop that cannot hand the event back (one within
//! `PmuConfig::keep_margin()` of the target without overflow records, or one
//! that finds the steps' notification lost) cancels it and records the
//! overshoot as a Tool-observable stop does. `Timer::retire()` records one
//! only for an event that no stop has decided (still Scheduled) whose
//! delivery point the guest has reached; an event already delivered, or
//! cancelled by a stop, is not recorded by it. Each of these records only
//! an undecided event and leaves it decided, so a single event is recorded
//! at most once. An event still undecided when its thread exits
//! (`Timer::settle_at_exit()`) is recorded if the guest reached its delivery
//! point. An event that ends with a non-leader exec without a stop having
//! found its delivery point reached, or that is overtaken by a stop of the
//! timer signal's own type, including a forged one, is not recorded.
//!
//! Where nothing continues an event across a stop that the Tool does not
//! see, the stop keeps the event only while the guest is more than
//! `PmuConfig::keep_margin()` RCBs short of its target. That margin is the
//! largest skid margin of any processor in the PMU table, plus the single
//! steps of an artificial notification, so the same guest clock keeps or
//! cancels the event on every supported processor; only a skid margin
//! override above the table's largest moves it.
//!
//! Proper use of timers requires that all delivered signals of type
//! `Timer::signal_type()` be passed through `Timer::handle_signal`, and that
//! `Timer::observe_event()` be called whenever a Tool-observable reverie event
//! occurs. A caller that observes a stop before it knows whether the Tool
//! observes it must pass a stop that the Tool does not observe to
//! `Timer::disregard_stop()`, and finish what of the active event this
//! returns with `Timer::continue_stepping()`. Additionally,
//! `Timer::finalize_requests()` must be called
//!  - after the end of the tool callback in which the user could have
//!    requested a timer event, i.e. those with `&mut guest` access.
//!  - after any reverie-critical single-stepping occurs (e.g. in syscall
//!    injections),
//!  - before resumption of the guest,
//!    which _usually_ means immediately after the tool callback returns.

///   registers and stays set when the tracee is resumed.

///   finds it when the syscall returns. It does so before any seccomp stop,
///   so a step that ends at one leaks it too, and again when a step restarts
///   an interrupted syscall.
///
/// In the first two ways the guest then runs with TF set and every
/// instruction traps.
///

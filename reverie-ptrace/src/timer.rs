//! Timers monitor a specified thread using the PMU and deliver a signal
//! after a specified number of events occur. The signal is then identified
//! and transformed into a reverie timer event. This is intended to allow
//! tools to break busywaits or other spins in a reliable manner. Timers
//! are ideally deterministic so that `detcore` can use them.
//!
//! Due to PMU skid, precise timer events must be driven to completion via
//! single stepping. This means the PMI is scheduled early, and events with very
//! short timeouts require immediate single stepping. Immediate stepping is
//! acheived by artificially generating a signal that will then be delivered
//! immediately upon resumption of the guest.
//!
//! Proper use of timers requires that all delivered signals of type
//! `Timer::signal_type()` be passed through `Timer::handle_signal`, and that
//! `Timer::observe_event()` be called whenever a Tool-observable reverie event
//! occurs. Additionally, `Timer::finalize_requests()` must be called
//!  - after the end of the tool callback in which the user could have
//!    requested a timer event, i.e. those with `&mut guest` access.
//!  - after any reverie-critical single-stepping occurs (e.g. in syscall
//!    injections),
//!  - before resumption of the guest,
//! which _usually_ means immediately after the tool callback returns.

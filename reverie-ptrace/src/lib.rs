//! Reverie ptrace backend.
//!
//! ptraced task implements `Guest` trait.
//!
//! `TracedTask` implements handlers for ptrace events including
//! seccomp. Notable ptrace events include:
//!
//! `PTRACE_EVENT_EXEC`: `execvpe` is about to return, tracee stopped
//!  at entry point.
//!
//! `PTRACE_EVENT_FORK/VFORK/CLONE`: when `fork`/`vfork`/`clone` is about
//! to return
//!
//! `PTRACE_EVENT_SECCOMP`: seccomp stop caused by `RET_TRACE`
//! NB: we patch syscall in seccomp ptrace stop.
//!
//! `PTRACE_EVENT_EXIT`: process is about to exit
//!
//! signals: tracee's pending signal stop.

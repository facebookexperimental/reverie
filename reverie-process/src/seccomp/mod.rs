//! Provides helpers for constructing a [`seccomp`][seccomp] filter. This is a
//! pure Rust implementation and does not require libseccomp.
//!
//! # Seccomp Background
//!
//! [`seccomp(2)`][seccomp] is a powerful tool for changing how a process tree
//! behaves when a syscall happens. Seccomp can be used to install a filter that
//! applies to every child process in a process tree. Since filters cannot be
//! removed, they can only get more restrictive. The language used for filters is
//! called `seccomp-bpf`. It is a subset of the BPF byte code language.
//!
//! Some of the restrictions include:
//!  - Only being able to JMP forward and never backward. This prevents loops and
//!    ensures seccomp-bpf filters always terminate. This is also true of BPF.
//!  - Cannot call libbpf functions.
//!  - Cannot operate on 64-bit integers, only 32-bit integers.
//!
//! [seccomp]: https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/seccomp.2.html
//!
//! You can think of a seccomp-bpf program as a little function that gets
//! executed for every syscall:
//!
//! ```no_compile
//! // NOTE: seccomp-bpf programs are actually written in byte code, but if a
//! // high-level language could be compiled to BPF byte code, this is what it'd
//! // look like.
//! fn my_program(data: seccomp_data) -> Action {
//!     if data.nr == 2 {
//!         return Action::Trace;
//!     }
//!
//!     if data.nr == 3 {
//!         return Action::KillProcess;
//!     }
//!
//!     // Allow the syscall by default.
//!     Action::Allow
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! where `seccomp_data` is defined as:
//!
//! ```no_compile
//! struct seccomp_data {
//!     // The syscall number.
//!     nr: u32,
//!     // The architecture.
//!     arch: u32,
//!     // Instruction pointer.
//!     ip: u64,
//!     // The 6 syscall arguments.
//!     args: [u64; 6],
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! This is the only input available to the seccomp filter and is the only bit of
//! data available to make a decision about a syscall (i.e., an "action"). An
//! action might be nothing (i.e., allow the syscall through), kill the
//! process/thread with `SIGSYS`, forward the syscall to ptrace, or return an
//! error code.
